I'm development a web chat as Proof of Concept to the feature in my company project using Laravel 5.8.* and VueJS.

## Resources Used

- **[Download and install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
- **[Install Laravel 5.8 with Composer](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/installation#installing-laravel).
- **[Download and install XAMPP with PHP 7.3.10 and MySQL 5.7](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/download.html).

## What I'm Going to Learn?

In this tutorial you will be able to develop your first web application using Laravel with VueJS. The application consists of a realtime chat.

## Running The Application Locally

After installing the mentioned features, you need to create a new MySQL database for the application. Then run `php artisan migrate` command and then `php artisan serve` on the Terminal.

Access `localhost:8000` to create a user for you on the system through the "Register" link. Then go to `localhost:8000/chat` to play with the application.
